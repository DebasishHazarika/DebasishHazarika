##Hi there, I'm Debasish Hazarika ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a Ph.D. researcher in Astronomy at the Institute of Astronomy and Planetary Sciences (INCT-UDA), University of Atacama, Chile. My research focuses on variable stars, Galactic structure, and the chemodynamics of the Milky Way, using data from large-scale surveys like S-PLUS and GAIA. I am deeply passionate about applying data-driven techniques to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos.

Apart from my work in astronomy, I am also interested in data science solutions for tackling complex research problems and real-world challenges. Whether it's analyzing large datasets, building machine learning models, or automating workflows, I enjoy solving problems with innovative and efficient methods.
